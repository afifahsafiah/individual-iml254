    <h1 class="main-title">Assalamualaikum. I’m Nur Afifah Safiah Binti Mat Nuri</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my personal website! I’m a Diploma in Library Informatics student passionate about knowledge management and digital systems. My goal is to make information accessible and preserve it for future generations.
    </p>

    <h2>My Personal Background</h2>
    <p>
        I was born in Terengganu and moved to Klang, Selangor, when I was 2 years old, and it was because of my father's work. When I was in elementary school, I was not a smart student and last in class, but I was really interested in math subjects. Even though I like math, I never passed the subject. Over time, when I was in high school, my mom asked me to study with this one teacher because a lot of my mom's friends' children got their math marks raised after studying with this teacher. After I tutored with this teacher, I always got a B mark in my mathematics subject.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills and Strengths</h2>
    <p>
        I’m skilled in library systems management, leadership, and teamwork. My strengths include strong organizational skills, problem-solving, and creativity in finding innovative solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My favorite color is purple 🪻</li>
        <li>I love taking photos 📸</li>
        <li>I can solve high school mathematics problems within 5 minutes 🧮🕰️</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>
    <p>
        My dream is to work as a digital archivist, preserving important information and making it accessible to everyone. I hope to create systems that blend tradition with modern technology to bridge the knowledge gap.
